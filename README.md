# PortScanner
Normal scanners are easy to write but what about getting information from the services at lower level, analyzing and modifying packets to send it back, analyzing services and protocols. The goal is to take the port scanner to the next level by working on it from scratch at a lower level.

This is educational purpose to see if i can push myself to create a scanner from scratch and keep building on it while keeping track of everything

## Current Goals
- [ ] Fast scanner
- [ ] Accurate Port Status detection (open, close filtered)
- [ ] Service information and Banner grabbing
- [ ] integration of the scanner with other tools


## Version tracking
The (Versions)[Versions.md] contains information for each version to keep track on everything including my take away, what changed, and finally what will the next Improvement be about.
